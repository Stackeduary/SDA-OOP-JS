// There must be a better way to create objects. I have to create 300 total used car objects and I don't want to have to copy paste and edit 299 of these :(

// class is a collection of objects

// create a constructor within the class that allows us to create objects much more quickly and efficiently than writing them manually in object literal syntax

// create a car class using the old ES5 syntax
